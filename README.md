*This repo uses the orphan branch strategy to store various  "repos" in this repo, currently its seems easier to manage than submodules*

Please note when viewing any code or notes the associated timestamp, as versions, API's patterns and practices can change in a short amount of time.

Also be aware that proficiences in languages,frameworks,platforms and libraries evolve over time, and that code in here reflects skills at the time of commit and not neccessarily present day.
