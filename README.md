# Todo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).


First app using angular 2/4, so it will most likely be relatively 'meh'.

May revise in near future:

TODO:

1. ~~Put logic into a service (read up on where to put state, as angular only seems to have component local state???)~~
2. ~~Fix up styling, make it look purtty.~~ sorta
3. ~~Add some basic tests~~ -- complete Todo Component tests (learn angular test bed thingy)
4. ~~Differentiate between completing a todo and deleting a todo~~
5. win!
